  <p1>My Story</p1>
  <p2>I am slavic of origin/nature. I was born in Kazakhstan, and when my parents had an opportunity to go to Russia they took it. We didn't live there long, about 1 year, until my  grandparents who moved to the US earlier called out my parents to move here, and I ended up in Spokane, WA. I was good at school growing up. I ended up going to college at EWU, didn't finish, moved out to King County, worked a few jobs, made my own business in remodeling, and eventually found my way back to what I went to college for 6 years later when a friend told me about code fellows. Now I'm hoping to find a good/reliable/stable software developement job once I'm done!
